# ACT Overlay by 라그린네
My modifications to a popular ACT Overlay created by 라그린네 for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Heavensward [3.0]. This project is based off the work of https://www.reddit.com/user/Ludamister who updated the overlay for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood [4.0] and translated the overlay to english.

Updated for Shadowbringers [5.0] to include BLU, GNB, and DNC. Also adjusted the job bars to match their corresponding soul crystal's color schemes.

Here are some previews of how it works.
